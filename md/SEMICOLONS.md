# Semicolons

  - [21.1](#semicolons--required) **Yup.** eslint: [`semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi)

    > Why? When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, it uses a set of rules called [Automatic Semicolon Insertion](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion) to determine whether it should regard that line break as the end of a statement, and (as the name implies) place a semicolon into your code before the line break if it thinks so. ASI contains a few eccentric behaviors, though, and your code will break if JavaScript misinterprets your line break. These rules will become more complicated as new features become a part of JavaScript. Explicitly terminating your statements and configuring your linter to catch missing semicolons will help prevent you from encountering issues.

    ```javascript
    // bad - raises exception
    const luke = {}
    const leia = {}
    [luke, leia].forEach((jedi) => jedi.father = 'vader')

    // bad - raises exception
    const reaction = "No! That’s impossible!"
    (async function meanwhileOnTheFalcon() {
      // handle `leia`, `lando`, `chewie`, `r2`, `c3p0`
      // ...
    }())

    // bad - returns `undefined` instead of the value on the next line - always happens when `return` is on a line by itself because of ASI!
    function foo() {
      return
        'search your feelings, you know it to be foo'
    }

    // good
    const luke = {};
    const leia = {};
    [luke, leia].forEach((jedi) => {
      jedi.father = 'vader';
    });

    // good
    const reaction = 'No! That’s impossible!';
    (async function meanwhileOnTheFalcon() {
      // handle `leia`, `lando`, `chewie`, `r2`, `c3p0`
      // ...
    }());

    // good
    function foo() {
      return 'search your feelings, you know it to be foo';
    }
    ```
